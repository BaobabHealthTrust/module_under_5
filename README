Instructions for Running Application

NB: The instructions below are ideal for applications intended to run on one database

To complete configuration of an application at a site, you are supposed to have "user managament" and "patient
registration" modules running, refer to D) on how to configure the two modules

In application.yml, 'user.management.url' should map to link of user management module
                    'patient.registration.url' should map to link of patient registration module

A I). If a database has not yet been configured by another application

    1. Edit config/database.yml.example to match correct database parameters
    2. Edit config/application.yml.example to match correct application parameters
        (The above files with be copied and renamed without .example extension when database initialization starts)
    3. Copy the protocol_task_flow.yml.example to protocol_task_flow.yml

        cp config/protocol_task_flow.yml.example  config/protocol_task_flow.yml

    4. Run the following command to initialize database while in application folder

        script/initial_database_setup.sh environment site

 I).  If a database has already been configured by another application run the following commands from application folder

       1. cp config/protocol_task_flow.yml.example  config/protocol_task_flow.yml
          cp config/database.yml.example  config/database.yml
          cp config/application.yml.example  config/application.yml

       2. Edit the the new files copied above with the right parameters

B.  



1. With external User Management and Patient Registration Modules.

 Run the application as is normally done
 
 2. With Internal User Management and Patient Registration Modules
 
 		a. Merge parent application routes with routes in user management and patient registration modules
 		b. Merge parent application library files in /lib with library files in user management and patient registration modules
 		c. Make sure that the line 
 			 config.reload_plugins = true

 			 Is available in file config/environment.rb
 		The application link can as well be used as link for user management and patient registration by other applications
